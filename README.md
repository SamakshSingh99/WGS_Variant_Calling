# WGS Variant Calling

The primary goal of this repository is to acquire knowledge and apply the concept of loops in shell scripting for the purpose of variant calling in Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data. This involves efficiently handling a larger set of Paired End WGS data provided for analysis.

__So as to run this script, following tools are used:__
* bwa/0.7.12
* gatk/4.1.9.0
